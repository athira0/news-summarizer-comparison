# Abstractive Text Summarization Web-App

Abstractive summarization is the process of generating a summary of a text by understanding its meaning and creating a new text that conveys the same information in a shorter form. Abstractive methods employ more powerful natural language processing techniques to interpret text and generate new summary text, as opposed to selecting the most representative existing excerpts to perform the summarization.

# Sample Input:
Gmail will soon have a feature that will write entire emails for you using AI, Google announced on Wednesday at its Google I/O event.

The feature, dubbed "help me write," is basically an expansion of the auto-replies and generative text that Google already uses in Gmail. While announcing the feature, Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google, used an example of asking an airline for a refund for a flight. The AI feature pulls info from previous exchanges with the airline and creates an entire message asking for the refund. You can then edit that message to your liking and send it away.
